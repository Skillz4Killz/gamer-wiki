# What is Support Feature useful for?

Aren't you tired of seeing users @mention moderators or entire roles to get help causing spam and making it much harder to provide help to users.

- âœ… Never miss a user asking for help again! Happy users increases user retention.
- âœ… Professionally designed customer support for Discord.
- âœ… Users get private help to anything they are concerned about. Users don't get attacked by other users for asking common basic questions.
- âœ… Users don't @mention every person in a role when only a couple are available.
- âœ… No longer DM one moderator waiting until that person replies. Get the fastest possible responses by easily contacting the entire staff team.
- âœ… Template responses to send quick and detailed responses for any common questions.
- âœ… Discord Support helps users so they don't need to email customer service saving money. ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°
