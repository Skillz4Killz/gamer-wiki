The feedback feature is the perfect feature when you want to collect suggestions or bug reports from your users. One of the most crucial things for any gaming server, is about collecting the best feedback that can be logged internally for game developers. With this in mind, we created a flexible and customizable feedback feature that provides the best experience for not just developers but users as well for sending feedback.

Sound good to you? Well, let's set it up then!

# Setting Up The Feedback Feature

Let's go ahead and get started.

Go into your server settings and make sure that the Gamer role has Administrator Permissions. If this is done, you can proceed:

`.setup feedback`

Now let's understand what just happened.

This command created a base feedback feature. First, it creates a channel for suggestions and another channel bug reports. Then, it will update all the feedback settings so that it is enabled with the default settings. Lastly, it sends in each channel a base example of what each type of feedback looks like.

> **Note:** After setup, you can remove the Administrator permissions.
> {.is-warning}

Go ahead and take a minute to try testing out how the feedback works.

`.feedback idea` will begin the Q&A session with the bot asking you the questions to send for the feedback. Once you answer all of them, a new feedback will be sent in the idea channel.
`.feedback bug` will begin a similar session but asking the questions for a bug report. Once complete, it will send a new bug report in the bugs channel.

Cool right? Sweet, now that you have the hang of this, let's try and customize this.

> **Advanced:** If you know all the questions, you can split your answers with | and it will work as well. As an example:
> `.fb idea I would suggest checking out the g4m3r server and website to learn all my other features and everything you can unlock. | High`
> {.is-success}

# Customizing The Questions

Every game has different needs and each feedback is extremely crucial to get the right information from a user. In order to perfect that, we allowed users to have the ability to customize the questions.

Now you can take a moment and pause here to come up with a list of questions you wants users to answer. Once you are ready, you can proceed and see how we add those questions.

For example, suppose you wanted to create the following questions for your bug reports.

- What is the account name, IGN, that experienced the bug?
- What is the server where the bug occurred? NA, EU, SEA, EA, SA, CN
- What device did the bug happen on? Phone + Phone Model, iPhone X, Samsung Galaxy Note 8, etc.
- What's the OS version of your device? Example: iOS 12.1, Android 8.0, Windows 10.
- Describe the bug as well as you can.
- How consistently are you able to reproduce this bug by following all the steps to reproduce above? From 1-100%
- Include any other information you find useful here, such as a link to a video/screenshot or additional comments about the bug. Put in none if no additional information available.

Now let's type:
`.settings bugsQuestions What is the account name, IGN, that experienced the bug?`

The key `bugsQuestions` saves all the questions for bugs. `ideaQuestions` is for all the questions saved for ideas. If the question already exists, it will remove it. Since this does not exist in our questions yet, this will add it.

Go ahead and repeat this command for each of the questions above. Once you are done, it is time to remove the original 2 questions that the `.setup` command created originally. To do that just type the following 2 commands:

```shell
.settings bugsQuestions What is the issue you are having?
.settings bugsQuestions Can you provide some links to screenshots please?
```

Tada! :tada: We now have a fully custom built feedback for bugs. Take some time and customize the questions for the idea feedback type.

# Understanding The Reactions

The reactions that are added to feedback allow users and moderators to have quick access to various parts of the feedback feature. Let's break it down:

> **Note:** The first two reactions, 👍 and 👎 can be customized. The `.setup` command that we ran earlier set two custom gamer emojis. You can keep them or change them. For the purposes of this guide we will just keep the emojis.
> `.settings ideaThumbsUp :emojiYouWantToUse:`
> The keys are: `ideaThumbsUp`, `ideaThumbsDown`, `bugsThumbsUp`, `bugsThumbsDown`,
> {.is-warning}

## Voting Reactions

Any user can react with these and give XP to a user. You can also remove the reaction and the XP is then removed. The XP is a perfect addition to the feedback feature because it gives users an incentive to be send good feedback. The amount of XP can be customized in detail. We will discuss this in the XP section below.

👍 : Whenever anyone reacts to this, it will **give** the original sender XP. Removing this reaction, **removes** that XP.
👎 : Whenever anyone reacts to this, it will **remove** the original sender's XP. Removing this reaction, **gives** that XP back.
❓: This reaction has no effect but was added for users when they are not sure whether to vote up or down.

## Mod Only Reactions

The functionality for these reactions will only work for Moderators or Admins.

📬 : When a moderator reacts to this, a new Mail will be opened on behalf of the original sender. This is useful for easily contacting the sender when you need more information regarding the feedback.
✅ : This reaction has 3 affects to it. First, it will mark the feedback as solved and delete it from the channel. Second, it will send a Direct Message to the original sender letting them know it will solved. Third it grants them bonus XP as well.
❌ : This reaction has 3 affects to it as well. It marks the feedback as denied and deletes it from the channel. Second, it will send a message to the user letting them know it was denied. Third, it removes XP from the user.

# Customizing The XP

One of the most useful parts of the feedback feature is that it also is tied into our leveling system. By having XP added or removed based on the type of feedback that is sent, it encourages users to send good feedback as much as possible. We also created a way to modify and allow server owners to customize the amount of feedback as much as possible.

## Default XP Values

Every reaction begins with a default value of XP that is given or removed. The ✅ and ❌ can only be given by moderators **ONE** time.

| Reaction | XP      |
| -------- | ------- |
| 👍       | ⬆ 3     |
| 👎       | ⬇ 3 XP  |
| ✅       | ⬆ 50 XP |
| ❌       | ⬇ 50 XP |
| ❓       | ---     | --- |
| 📬       | ---     | --- |

## Changing XP Values

To change the value of a reaction you can use the settings command as shown below.

`.settings ideaXpUp 10` ~ Sets the XP given when someone adds the 👍 reaction for a **idea** type of feedback.

- The first part is `.settings` which must always be the same. For short, you can also use `.s`.
- The second part is `ideaXpUp`. This is a special key that represents how much XP is given when someone votes up 👍for an **idea** type of feedback. A list of all available keys is below.
- The third part is `10`. This is the new amount of XP you want to give or remove from the user for this action.

## XP Value Keys

- `ideaXpUp` ~ 👍
- `ideaXpDown` ~ 👎
- `ideaXpSolved` ~ ✅
- `ideaXpDenied` ~ ❌
- `bugsXpUp` ~ 👍
- `bugsXpDown` ~ 👎
- `bugsXpSolved` ~ ✅
- `bugsXpDenied` ~ ❌

# Feedback Logs

When a feedback is reacted to with the solved or denied reactions, it gets removed. For this purpose, gamer also provides a log feature for the feedback.

`.settings bugsLogChannelID #channel` ~ Sets the channel to send bugs reports.
`.settings bugsLogChannelID #channel` ~ Sets the channel to send bugs reports.

> **Note:** It is recommended to keep these channels private from public. Usually, they are used for discussing feedback internally if needed.
> {.is-warning}

# Exporting Feedback

Sometimes game developers have different internal tools that they use to track and work with feedback. To make it easy to transfer the feedback from discord to an external source we created the `.export` command.

This command converts feedback into a **CSV** file which can be easily upload to a google spreadsheet or converted into anything you like.

To use this command, you find the ID number of the feedback you want to **START** at. All feedback found after this feedback will be exported into a CSV file.

As this command is quite heavy on the bots performance we have added a cooldown for this command. It is one of the very few commands on the bot that has a cooldown.

# Further Customizations

There are a lot more ways you can customize the feedback module. To see all the options you can type `.settings feedback`.
